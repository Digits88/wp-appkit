## News
* 05/04/2015: Version 0.3: discover its totally new revamped UI!
* To know about changes in this version, read the [changelog](https://github.com/uncatcrea/wp-app-kit/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## What Is WP-AppKit?
It's a WordPress plugin which provides:
* An admin panel to configure your app
* JSON web services to feed your app with WordPress content
* A JavaScript engine to create app's themes
* Sample themes to trigger your natural inclination to unbridled creativity

WP-AppKit uses the [Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) technology for the app. It means that the app is developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript but still can be distribued in app stores.

## The WordPress Admin Panel
WP-AppKit adds a menu to the WordPress admin.
* Here you can choose the targeted platform
* Pick a theme
* Pick the app's components (eg. Post List)
* Build the app's navigation
* Use Chrome to simulate your app in the browser
* Export the app's sources ready to be compiled with [PhoneGap Build](https://build.phonegap.com/)

## App Themes
WP-AppKit allows to create themes for your apps. As we use the Cordova technology, app themes are build with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. WP-AppKit provides a JavaScript engine able to interact with the WP-AppKit web services. It also mimics WordPress themes with files such as single, archive... You will also be able to use template tags.

However an app's theme *is not* a WordPress theme.

WP-AppKit themes use JavaScript (along with HTML and CSS) instead of PHP. Template Tags for example use [UnderscoreJS](http://underscorejs.org/).

Developing app themes are at the heart of the WP-AppKit project. If you're ready to dive into the mysteries of app themes, head to the doc: http://uncategorized-creations.com/wp-appkit/doc/.
